This code will add Gcam access to a player and that player only.
Use the "Execute Code" module from Zeus run in "local" mode.
Replace "Seb" with your player's in-game name (your Arma 3 profile name), or the player you want to have camera access.
Camera access will be lost on player death, reconnect or respawn and must be re-added.
