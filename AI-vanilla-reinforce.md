# Vanilla(-ish) AI reinforce script

This adds waypoints to idle groups, leading them towards the last known enemy
position. This is done only once per `COMBAT` (red face in Zeus UI) - a group
which exits combat (back to `AWARE` / yellow face) can then call for
reinforcements again once it again enters combat and spots an enemy.

The script is not perfect, but fairly simple and should work well for Zeus-less
or Zeus-light missions where a GM doesn't want to do everything all the time.

Groups in `CARELESS` or `STEALTH` will be left alone. Groups with waypoints
will also not be touched (to avoid conflicts with GM), except for groups which
have a `CYCLE` waypoint - these are considered idle patrols and will get their
current waypoints deleted, replaced with the one pointing the group towards
spotted enemies.

Vehicles will be directed to an *appropriate* position close to where the enemy
was spotted, ideally with eyes on that position. They'll try to avoid forests,
insides of buildings, the sea, etc.

Air and Sea assets are completely excluded - both from having reinforcements
called upon them, and for being considered as reinforcing elements. It's assumed
that the mission maker / GM wants these for something special.

Stationary groups (garrisoned with disabled `PATH` or `MOVE` or static weapons)
will just be alerted to the enemy's position (via `reveal`) and will receive no
waypoints.

## How to use

1. Place down A3AA -> Execute Code module and double click on it
1. Set "Execute on (MP)" to "Server only"
1. Un-check "Execute for JIP players"
1. Set "Environment" to "Unscheduled"
1. Copy/paste the following into the "Code" box
1. (Optionally tweak the alert/reinforcement radius, centered on the requestor.)

```sqf
