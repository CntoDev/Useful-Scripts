/* 		Crew Vision Map System

This will create and update a map marker where the gunner & commander are looking for every crew member of a given vehicle.
It will also create a cone of vision, based on their current FOV.

This is designed for multiplayer with player crew members only.
It will only work if the gunner or commander is a player.

HOW TO USE:
Add this script to your mission's folder, and in the init of your vehicle add the following:
this execVM "CrewVisionMap.sqf";

To initialise for more than one vehicle, simply copy that same init code to the new vehicle.

This will only work if the vehicle has a "gunner" OR "commander" slot, or both. If it only has 1 of those that's fine, it's just pointless to use if these slots do not exist.

Must be executed locally, do not wrap in ifServer.

Does not work for the Blackfish.
