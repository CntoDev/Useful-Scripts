We have an InstaOSD module displaying player's location/time on mission start
which you can use (under Modules -> A3EE), but you can also re-use the
text-typing functionality for your own text to be displayed on the screen.

Dachi used a similar script in recent missions (2016/09), but that one used
absolute screen coordinates and thus was partially cut for me (1680x1050)
and anybody else using anything other than 1920x1080.

This can be fixed by referencing "safe zone" edges instead of absolute pixel
coordinates, https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/SafeZone .

Our text-typing implementation uses it and therefore should be correctly
positioned regardless of the player's UI size, aspect ratio or resolution.


To use, specify in init.sqf (or on Logic unit init line) one of:


["first line", "second line"] call a3ee_fnc_typeText;


[
    "first line",
    "second line",
    ["third line with big bold text", true],
    "fourth line"
] call a3ee_fnc_typeText;


For example,

[
    ["Operation Tough Job", true],
    "CNTO Ranger Patrol",
    "Seize the Radio tower",
    "2016-01-01 11:22"
] call a3ee_fnc_typeText;
